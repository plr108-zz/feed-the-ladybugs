SETUP

* Simply download this repository and open index.html to play the game.

GAMEPLAY

* Press the arrow keys to move the player.

* The goal of the game is to move the player to the water at the top of the screen 
  as many times as possible.

* The player starts with two lives.  

* The player must avoid the ladybugs that appear on the screen.  If the player
  comes in contact with a ladybug, the player loses a life (and the ladybug gets
  a snack).

* Every time the player reaches the water the player completes a level.  
  The player will gain an extra life for completing the level, but the 
  ladybugs will also speed up by 10 percent!

* The game is over when the player runs out of lives.

* Refresh the browser to reset the game.

Have fun feeding the ladybugs!
